### Introduction
----------
The idea came after watching this video from Dev Ed ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg9r_yLk7VY)).

Instead of playing around with Amazon, which is quite unfamiliar to VN users, I think it's better if we select Tiki as our base.

Briefly, this notebook is divided into 2 parts:

1. Scape SKU's information (title, price, discount, etc.)
2. Send an automated email if some conditions are met.

**Result**
